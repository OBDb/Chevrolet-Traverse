    description: "The original Chevrolet Traverse was a full-size crossover SUV built on GM's Lambda platform (GMT561) shared with the Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia, and Saturn Outlook. Introduced at the 2008 Chicago Auto Show, production began in Spring Hill, Tennessee in 2008 and moved to Delta Township, Michigan in 2010. It replaced the Uplander minivan and TrailBlazer SUV, featuring unibody construction for better ride quality and interior space utilization than traditional body-on-frame SUVs. Powered by a 3.6L LLT V6 engine producing between 281-288 HP depending on the model year, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations, it offered seating for up to eight passengers with class-leading cargo space. The interior focused on family-friendly features including available rear-seat entertainment, multiple USB ports, and flexible seating configurations. This generation established the Traverse as Chevrolet's largest crossover, offering minivan-like space with SUV styling."
